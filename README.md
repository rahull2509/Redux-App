# Redux-App

A React application scaffold (Create React App) in this repository. The project currently contains a Create React App structure (src/, public/) and standard React tooling. Despite the repository name, Redux is not included in package.json — instructions to add Redux are included below.

## Status
- Repository: rahull2509/Redux-App
- Default branch: main
- Last pushed: 2025-10-20
- Language: JavaScript
- License: None specified

## What this repo contains
A minimal Create React App project layout:
- public/ — static assets and index.html
- src/ — application source code (React)
- package.json / package-lock.json — project metadata and dependencies
- .gitignore

## Technologies (from package.json)
- React 19.x
- react-dom 19.x
- react-scripts 5.x (Create React App)
- Testing libraries:
  - @testing-library/dom
  - @testing-library/jest-dom
  - @testing-library/react
  - @testing-library/user-event
- web-vitals

Note: Redux (redux, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit) is not present in the current dependencies list.

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS)
- npm (bundled with Node) or yarn

Quick install
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# start the dev server
npm start
```

Available npm scripts (from package.json)
- npm start — starts the development server (react-scripts start)
- npm run build — builds the app for production (react-scripts build)
- npm test — runs the test runner (react-scripts test)
- npm run eject — ejects Create React App configuration (irreversible)

## Project structure (expected)
A typical structure for this scaffold:

```
Redux-App/
├─ public/
│  └─ index.html
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ App.js
│  ├─ App.css
│  └─ ... (components, styles, tests)
├─ package.json
├─ package-lock.json
└─ .gitignore
```

Adjust based on the actual files in src/ and public/.

## Adding Redux (optional)
If your intent is to build a "Redux-App", install Redux and the recommended toolkit:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

Basic setup example (very small sketch):

- src/store.js
```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
// import your reducers here
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // sliceName: sliceReducer
  },
});
```

- src/index.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App';
import { store } from './store';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

Create slices with createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit and add them to configureStore.

## Testing
This project uses React Testing Library packages included in package.json. Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
Follow Create React App test runner prompts to run/update tests.
